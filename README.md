# MDIntrinsicDimension 

MDIntriniscDimension is a Python package for the estimatation of  the intrinsic dimension (ID) of high-dimensional data from protein molecular dynamics, helping you reduce data to a lower-dimensional manifold while preserving essential information.

It includes three functions and as many analysis modes:    

- `intrinsic_dimension`: ID on whole molecule. 
- `section_id`: ID on fixed sliding window along protein's sequence.    
- `secondary_structure_id`: ID on contiguous secondary structure elements.


Conceptual background: Intrinsic dimension (ID)
-----------------

In this package, the intrinsic dimension (ID) of an MD trajectory is used as a compact measure of the effective number of independent collective coordinates that describe
the sampled fluctuations. Unlike the formal number of atomic degrees of freedom, ID discounts frozen or highly correlated directions and focuses on the modes that are
actually explored on the timescale and in the chosen feature space.

We typically work with internal-coordinate projections (e.g., backbone ϕ/ψ dihedrals, inter-residue distances, or χ side-chain dihedrals). Distance- and backbone-based
projections mainly report on global folding state and large-scale structural rearrangements, while χ-based projections are more sensitive to side-chain conformational
heterogeneity (e.g., in binding sites).

ID is estimated using algorithms from the [`scikit-dimension`](https://github.com/j-bac/scikit-dimension) library, with Two Nearest Neighbours (TwoNN) as the default.
Intuitively, these estimators infer dimensionality from how neighbour distances scale with radius in configuration space. In practice, ID plays a role analogous to
“number of significant principal components or tICs” required to capture most of the variance, but accounting for time-dependent (instantaneous) variations and non-linear dependencies.


Installation
------------

We recommend `uv venv` to create an isolated environment and `uv pip` or `uv sync`  to install:

```bash
uv pip install git+https://github.com/icazzaniga/MDIntrinsicDimension.git
```
or:   

```bash
git clone https://github.com/icazzaniga/MDIntrinsicDimension.git
uv sync
```

Documentation
------------

It is available online at https://giorginolab.github.io/MDIntrinsicDimension/ .


Quick start
------------
ID can be computed as follows:

```python
    
    #ID of the entire object
    intrinsic_dimension(topology = 'villin/2f4k.pdb', trajectory = 'villin/2f4k_f1.xtc')

    #ID per fixed windows
    section_id(topology = 'villin/2f4k.pdb', trajectory = 'villin/2f4k_f1.xtc')  

    #ID contiguous secondary structure elements
    secondary_structure_id(topology = 'villin/2f4k.pdb', trajectory = 'villin/2f4k_f1.xtc')
```

Any other parameter shared by the functions or specific for each, has a default.

Example notebooks
-----------------


The documentation includes example notebooks that demonstrate the package’s features and reproduce (and extend) the figures from the paper. To run these notebooks, you have two options:

1.	Use the original DESRES MD trajectories of villin and NTL9 by [Lindorff-Larsen et al.](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6055/517). These must be downloaded, pre-processed, and placed in the `examples` directory.
2.	Use the provided pre-computed data tables, available in CSV format, which require no trajectory downloads.

The pre-processing steps are described at the top of the [Villin Headpiece](docs/villin_plots.ipynb) and [NTL9](docs/NTL9_plots.ipynb) notebooks. The same notebooks also appear in the online [documentation](https://giorginolab.github.io/MDIntrinsicDimension/) under the Examples section, with some code hidden for readability. The full source code is included in the notebooks themselves and associated files.



Dependencies
------------

They are automatically installed.
